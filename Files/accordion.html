        <h5>Support for Israel</h5>
    </div>
    <div class="accContent">
        <p>In partnership with Jewish Federationsâ€™ Israel Office, we will advocate for a robust US-Israel relationship, ensuring that Israel receives the vital resources and military assistance needed to be victorious in the face of any foreign aggression.</p>

        <p>As Israel is a vibrant democracy with a strong, independent judiciary, Jewish Federations will oppose efforts to sanction Israelis and Israeli organizations.</p>

        <p>We will continue to oppose de-legitimization efforts, such as the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement, while promoting policies that foster normalization of relations between Israel and other countries.</p>

        <p>Furthermore, we will actively pursue expanded Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) and agreements that benefit both Israel and the United States.</p>

        <p>Our efforts will also focus on supporting programs and initiatives aimed at fostering a peaceful future between Israel and the Palestinian people and a two-state solution where Israel lives in peace with a demilitarized Palestinian state.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="accContent">
        <p>Jewish Federations strongly support the Abraham Accords and are committed to fostering the expansion of these historic agreements to promote peace, cooperation, and prosperity throughout the Middle East.</p>
        <p>By encouraging new partnerships between Israel and additional Arab and Muslim-majority countries, Jewish Federations aim to contribute to greater regional stability, economic development, and diplomatic progress.</p>
        <p>We believe that expanding the Abraham Accords will create opportunities for mutual benefit, foster peaceful coexistence, and lay the foundation for a more secure and prosperous future for all nations in the region.</p>
